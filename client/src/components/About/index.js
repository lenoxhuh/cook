          My name is Lenox Huh, and I play lacrosse at IMG Academy. On the lacrosse team, we are expected to maintain a balanced nutrition plan in order to supplement our rigorous training routine. While student-athletes at our school regularly meet with nutritionists and are provided with optimal meals, most aspiring athletes our age lack the resources necessary to reach their goals.

          This website, HouseOfGainz, redefines the traditional fitness application by providing readers the information they actually need. Nutrition Guides, Recipes, and Articles from a collection of world-class nutritionists and my own personal experiences as a high school athlete will equip users with readily available information that transcends any other internet resource. 
              </p>

          I hope this platform gives insight to approaching your fitness goals and inspires you to get those Gainz! ðŸ’ª Happy lifting!
